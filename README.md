# reading-summarizer
A lightweight, database-free system for collecting, deduplicating, and summarizing high-quality essays, blog posts, and research articles. The project ingests URLs or curated sources, extracts clean article content, generates structured summaries with LLMs, and stores results as local Markdown files for long-term reading and knowledge reuse.
